        Hi, my name is Jason Grant. I am currently a student at the University of Oregon. I am studying to become a full stack web developer. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, and React. I am also learning how to use Git and GitHub. I am excited to learn more about web development and to start my career in the field.
